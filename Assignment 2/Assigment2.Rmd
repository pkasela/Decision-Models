# Introduction

The **Manifacturing INC** (MNC) makes four different metal alloys: A, B, C and D.
The company is barely able to keep up with the increasing demand for these products. However, increasing raw material prices and foreign competition are forcing MNC to watch its margins to ensure it is operating in the most efficient manner possible.

# Marketing Demands

To meet marketing demands for the coming week, MNC needs to produce

- at least 1,200 pounds of the A product,
- between 450 and 650 pounds of the B product,
- no more than 120 pounds of the C product, and
- no more than 150 pounds of D product.


# Production Requirements

Each pound of the A, B, C, and D product contains, respectively, 55%, 45%, 25%, and 100% aluminum made up of copper.

The company has 1300 pounds of aluminum and 900 pounds of copper copper for use in the next week.

The various products are made using four different machines: forger, reamer, shaper, and planer. The following table summarizes the time required by each product on each machine. Each machine has 60 hours of time available in the coming week.
